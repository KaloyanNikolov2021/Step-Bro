✨ What this project is
Small wearable IoT fitnes device that goes on one of your ankles. It gives you all sorts of useful information.

Appropiate for mid to long distance runners from every point of expertise.

Easy to connect to your phone with Bluetooth, also doesn't need a smart watch of any sort to work. Charges with USB-C.

Gives adequate readings from every run and gives you tips & tricks and general advice how to improve your running form

Some of  the information includes:

- Orbit of leg movement
- Speed readings
- Power rating & etc.

Designed as part of a diploma project at one of Bulgaria’s top technical high schools, showing how far a school‑level project can be pushed.
​

🎯 Why it’s cool
Uses real ToF sensing (not just ultrasonic/IR), which is the same class of tech used in modern phones, robots and AR devices.​

Focused on reliability and debuggability: serial output, LED feedback and structured firmware instead of throwaway demo code.​

Built completely by a single 18‑year‑old student, from hardware wiring to firmware and documentation, as a full end‑to‑end system.
​

🔒 Availability & usage
This is a personal, academic project, published for reference only.

Not intended for commercial use.

Not designed as a reusable library, template, or general‑purpose module.

Please do not fork it as a base for your own product; treat it as a showcase / portfolio piece instead.
